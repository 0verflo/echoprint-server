# Server components for Echoprint.

**Please note: this is not the final version and will likely not store codes that match release Echoprint codes.**

Echoprint is an open source music fingerprint and resolving framework powered by the [The Echo Nest](http://the.echonest.com/ "The Echo Nest"). The [code generator](http://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen "echoprint-codegen") (library to convert PCM samples from a microphone or file into Echoprint codes) is MIT licensed and free for any use. The [server component](http://github.com/echonest/echoprint-server "echoprint-server") that stores and resolves queries is Apache licensed and free for any use. The [data for resolving to millions of songs](http://echoprint.me/data "Echoprint Data") is free for any use provided any changes or additions are merged back to the community. 

## What is included

The Echoprint server is a custom component for Apache Solr to store and index Echoprint codes and hash times. We also include the python API layer code necessary to match tracks based on the response from the custom component as well as a demo (non-production) API meant to illustrate how to setup and run the Echoprint service.

Non-included requirements for the server (newota):

* java 1.6
* python 2.5 or higher
* simplejson (if python < 2.6)

Additional non-included requirements for the demo:

* web.py


## What's inside

    API/ - python libraries for querying and ingesting into the Echoprint server
    API/api.py - web.py sample API wrapper for evaluation
    API/fp.py - main python module for Echoprint
    API/solr.py - Solr's python module (with slight enhancements)

    Hashr/ - java project for a custom solr field type to handle Echoprint data

    solr/ - complete solr install with Hashr already in the right place and with the right schema and config to make it work.


## How to run the server

1. Start the server like this (change your home directory to where you have echoprint-server/solr/solr)

    java -Dsolr.solr.home=/Users/bwhitman/outside/echoprint-server/solr/solr/solr/ -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar start.jar

If you run this server somewhere else other than localhost, update the pointer to it in fp.py:

    _fp_solr = solr.SolrConnection("http://localhost:8502/solr/fp")


## Running in Python

fp.py has all the methods you'll need.

    >>> import fp
    >>> fp.ingest({"my_track_id":"123 40 123 60 123 80 123 90 123 110 123 130"})
    >>> fp.commit()
    >>> r = fp.best_match_for_query("123 40 123 60 123 80 123 90 123 110 123 130 123 150 123 160 123 80")
    >>> r.message()
    'no results found (type 2)'
    >>> example_code = "eJx1VFuSxCAIvBLyEDyOot7_CAtkp2qmdvaniYqdpiEBVGL4Dt3-geHfwSCuWfcPmPABm7_DAPsHKFjG5L-w7Rcm-AsY_oLyLyxOUPuA6e_gHHuu-bTgBSeuXYynK_wAtQEvcP4Hrn0HRAciirvk8RQaAyIQh7vfYfgLNvyChGsP9PDgDUaLvcH2AVHRNwAYg_qJ2M5qUWI4KtAiRqGe53cP6xFd-s08Z4RU3Jgk84zWldw_dDK_rR2eAWxR0fd9xE5Z6bC5k9dO8bzi7CEk-WBorsGm2Rdd--5buml62A-Hs_GxP7fnOSyD5EHHchaQsomg16ScDvNvRKFburT3OjfZI_l8Lsn3yVqlK6rR5F2bUYvnQPqw7srrcNn7Kp_QS28zLv92fCwZB5OWz5Pzgqvma4BZH54Y0lsyV88IA2SWb50yIj58bUzKfB0lD9YxK948yLyWlYXuI30WDUj67D4x73Vpp_yIPqauZoTy6Gy5XtxO-adzZz5NxVx3jwbkubJXP9HLV7XVs16LT5De8nqMZPm3hal4YZSeTe1UPV79l7s5jQiaGpg1tOapL4LUhYBnVN3iu_qpVR_tps9c6i67xE_N5YSaY4uOZbwoE6t_k1rNLSypPvTqf_wa6v13tupfdBczdovfRPnYMPULPHMfp2v_ADyGOfw="
    >>> r = fp.best_match_for_query(example_code)
    >>> r.message()
    'OK (match type 5)'
    >>> r.TRID
    u'thisone'

## Running the example API server

1. Run the api.py webserver as a test

    cd API
    python api.py 8080

2. Ingest codes with http://localhost:8080/ingest:

POST the following variables:

    fp_code : packed code from codegen
    track_id : if you want your own track_ids. If you don't give one we'll generate one.
    length : the length of the track in ms
    artist : the artist of the track (optional)
    release : the release of the track (optional)
    track : the track name (optional)

For example:

    curl http://localhost:8080/ingest -d "fp_code=eJx1W...&track_id=thisone&length=30000"

3. Query with http://localhost:8080/query?fp_code=XXX

POST or GET the following:

    fp_code : packed code from codegen


## Notes

* This version both indexes and stores FP data in solr. This is for ease of installation and so that we don't require another datastore booted in order to get going. In practice it is necessary to use a key-value or other fast random access store for large catalogs. If you do this, change schema.xml to not store the "fp" field (keep it indexed):

        <field name="fp" type="fphash" indexed="true" stored="false" required="true"/>

Then override fp.py's fp_code_for_track_id method with your own datastore accessor.

* You can run Echoprint in "local" mode which uses a python dict to store and index codes instead of Solr. You can store and index about 100K tracks in 1GB or so in practice using this mode. This is only useful for small scale testing. Each fp.py method takes an optional "local" kwarg.
